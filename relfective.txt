Reflective report –
-	Ended up doing something which didn’t particularly interest me –UI programing has its challenges and is important to a game, but over the course of the module I kind of realised that the direction I wanted to take in the industry was more creative and design orientated than strictly coding.
-	In UI, I felt really far away from the rest of the team, kind of doing my own thing without a huge amount of oversite. This experience was quite valuable – I felt like I could write features that I thought were interesting, instead of having much direct oversite. On the other hand, I also felt a little side-lined, a lot of the features which I implemented were not really supported by the rest of the team. 
-	An example of this was RuShi’s desk, which I proposed at the start of the project as an idea for a diegetic menu screen, where the player would play as RuShi, at a desk on a space station. 
-	I thought this was a good idea. My thinking was that this succinctly expressed the story relationship between RuShi and REV – that RuShi was controlling REV from a space station above the planet. I also thought it allowed for lots of characterisation of RuShi from the menu screen- the music RuShi is playing, the things lying around her desk, even programs she might have on her computer- all of these things give a sense of who this character is and more about the world she inhabits. 
-	This idea evolved from my implementation of the hud, where I realised that UI elements are components of objects – which can be rendered in world space as opposed to just screen space. This was a case where design ideas came from the inherent possibilities of code.
-	It also revealed to me that on reflection – the desk wasn’t actually that important. Instead it was a step towards realising a way I work. What I need to do to feel like I am doing good and important work.  That some creative freedom is essential to my motivation – and even to some small degree my mental health. 
-	In a talk, Johnathan Blow describes the idea of game design as building a space of rules, and asking questions of this space. 
-	“You build constructs out of  ‘what If’ questions and then ask what the consequences are” https://youtu.be/OGSeLSmOALU -Jonathan Blow- Designing to Reveal the Nature of the Universe
-	I could make an analogy to Conways Game of Life, where a small set of rules add together to produce something more complex than the individual rules would suggest. The rules and consequences form the design space

-	If I were to be critical of the designers on this project I would probably say that the ‘design space’ of the project wasn’t widened significantly.
